# A Simulation of Mathematical Billiards
Mathematical billiards involves a single billiards ball elastically colliding
with the boundary of a frictionless, pocketless table. The dynamics of
different table shapes have different applications, such as finding the
highest common factor between two natural numbers. The aim of this
project is to simulate mathematical billiards on rectangular, elliptical and
Bunimovich-stadium tables.

## How To Use
On starting the program, the user is guided through several prompts to set up the parameters of the billiards table:
- Type of table (rectangular, elliptical or stadium).
- Dimensions of table.
- Starting position of billiards ball.
- Angle of initial trajectory of billiards ball.
- Number of collisions to simulate.

If the user enters an erroneous input (for example, a word when a number is required), they will be asked for another input until their input is acceptable.

Once all inputs have been entered, the user is shown an animated plot of the trajectory of the ball for the number of collisions specified. If appropriate, a phase space plot is also shown.
